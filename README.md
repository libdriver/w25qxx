## LibDriver W25QXX

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/w25qxx/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The W25Q25XX Serial Flash memory provides a storage solution for systems with limited space, pins and power. The 25Q series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash devices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM, executing code directly from Dual/Quad SPI (XIP) and storing voice, text and data. The device operates on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 4mA active and 1μA for power-down. All devices are offered in space-saving packages.

LibDriver W25QXX is a full-featured driver for W25QXX, launched by LibDriver.It provides flash reading, flash writing and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver W25QXX source files.

/interface includes LibDriver W25QXX SPI or QSPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver W25QXX driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver W25QXX sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver W25QXX offline document.

/datasheet includes W25QXX datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SPI or QSPI platform independent template and finish your platform SPI or QSPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_w25qxx_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t manufacturer;
uint8_t device_id;
uint8_t data[8];

res = w25qxx_basic_init(W25Q128, W25QXX_INTERFACE_SPI, W25QXX_BOOL_TRUE);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
res = w25qxx_basic_get_id((uint8_t *)&manufacturer, (uint8_t *)&device_id);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)w25qxx_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}
w25qxx_interface_debug_print("w25qxx: manufacturer is 0x%02X device id is 0x%02X.\n", manufacturer, device_id);
    
...    
    
res = w25qxx_basic_write(0x00000000, (uint8_t *)data, 8);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)w25qxx_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...

res = w25qxx_basic_read(0x00000000, (uint8_t *)data, 8);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)w25qxx_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...
    
(void)w25qxx_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example advance

```C
#include "driver_w25qxx_advance.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t manufacturer;
uint8_t device_id;
uint8_t data[8];

res = w25qxx_advance_init(W25Q128, W25QXX_INTERFACE_SPI, W25QXX_BOOL_TRUE);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
res = w25qxx_advance_get_id((uint8_t *)&manufacturer, (uint8_t *)&device_id);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)w25qxx_advance_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}
w25qxx_interface_debug_print("w25qxx: manufacturer is 0x%02X device id is 0x%02X.\n", manufacturer, device_id);
    
...    
    
res = w25qxx_advance_write(0x00000000, (uint8_t *)data, 8);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)w25qxx_advance_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...

res = w25qxx_advance_read(0x00000000, (uint8_t *)data, 8);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)w25qxx_advance_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...
    
(void)w25qxx_advance_deinit();

return 0;
```
